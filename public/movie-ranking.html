<h1>My favorite movies probably I can't remember</h1>
<h2>First three movies I can think of off the top of my head so they're probably pretty good</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Silence of the Lambs</h3>
<p>Movie that sounds a lot scarier than it is. Heard it mentioned as a really scary or horrifying book, but, at leas the movie, wasn't too bad. Quite enjoyed it. Reading the book rn if I can keep my damn attention on it.</p>

<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>Still trying to convince my mom to watch this movie. It's a fun one I promise.</p>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Mainly thought of this because our dear Angela mentioned it, but hey, it's a good movie.</p>

<h2>Worst movie(s) of all time</h2>

<h3>Avatar the last airbender movie</h3>
<p>Just complete trash, disservice to the original</p>
